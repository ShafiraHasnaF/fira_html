                I worked as a Web Developer and Video Editor, focusing on website development and digital content creation.<br><br>
                My main responsibilities included developing and maintaining website features using PHP (CodeIgniter 4 & Laravel),
                as well as creating and editing video content for company needs.<br><br>
                Through this internship, I improved both my technical and creative skills, especially in web development,
                backend logic, and digital media production.

            I worked in the Mechanical Production division, focusing on a web-based machine inspection system.<br><br>
            I was involved in developing and managing the inspection system using JavaScript, which was used to monitor
            and record the condition of mechanical equipment.<br><br>
            This internship gave me experience working in an industrial environment and helped me understand how web
            technology is applied in real operational systems.
